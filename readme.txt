After some days of build the "app", i reviewed it in cold and found some upgrades to do.

1. I could add a flex-wrap class in the result page to make it responsive, add a min/max-with to the cards or make all w-fit.
2. Create a SingleFilter component. In my actual Filters.tsx i have to create an useState var for each filter, and i could make it more dynamic.
3. In case of showing more info for the cars, i should create a a Card.tsx component.
4. In the filters i should use query params to make it more dynamic and shareable Links.
5. Sort the cars makers in the filter by name.

Adding those things would make the app more dynamic and responsive, but it would take more time to build it and i dont know if this is against the assignment rules (doing it later).

Thanks Devlops Today team for the opportunity. Gustavo.
